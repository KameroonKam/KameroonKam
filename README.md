### About Me

I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Manchester with a strong interest in building **reliable, user-focused software** and **data-driven systems** with real-world impact.

My experience spans software engineering fundamentals, applied projects, and team-based development — from AI-supported prototypes and web applications to systems-level coursework. I’m particularly interested in **mission-driven products**, where technology, data, and user trust matter.

Alongside technical work, I’ve taken on leadership and representative roles, which shaped how I collaborate, communicate, and take ownership in team environments.
