# Hi, I’m Kamron 👋

I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Manchester with a strong interest in building **reliable, user-focused software** and **data-driven systems** with real-world impact.

I enjoy working across the full development cycle — from problem analysis and system design to implementation and iteration — and I’m particularly interested in **software engineering**, **AI-supported products**, and **health-tech**.

## Technical Interests & Skills

- **Programming:** Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL (MySQL), PHP
- **Web:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Systems & Engineering:** RISC-V Assembly, SystemVerilog  
- **Tools:** Git, Figma  
- **Game Development:** Godot Engine (GDScript)

## Selected Projects

- **NeuroGuard** — AI-powered mental state monitoring system  
  *Built during a 24-hour hackathon; combines machine learning, a Flask backend, and a web interface to explore data-driven wellbeing support.*

- **Spot Version 3** — Student coursework platform redesign  
  *Redesigned a university platform to improve deadline tracking and grade visibility; project awarded “Most Carefully Routed Application” among ~80 submissions.*

- **HeyNinja** — 2D game prototype  
  *Developed in Godot with custom gameplay logic, hitbox-based collisions, basic enemy AI, and self-designed visual assets.*

## Leadership & Collaboration

Alongside technical work, I’ve taken on leadership and representative roles, including:
- Student Representative for Computer Science students  
- Volunteer Coordinator managing large teams at a major cultural festival  

These experiences shaped how I work in teams: with ownership, clear communication, and respect for different perspectives.
